# Python Assignment 1

This repository contains my solutions for **Python Assignment 1**, implemented in a single notebook.  
The assignment explores key programming concepts and fundamental Python structures through small, focused exercises.  
A separate PDF file, **`Py1_outputs.pdf`**, is also included to show the notebook’s executed outputs and verify that all code runs correctly.

## Contents

### 0. Data Types, Structures, Indexing, and Slicing  
Introduces Python’s mutable and immutable objects, string manipulation, and slicing operations.

### 1. Conditional Statements  
Translates MATLAB `switch` statements into Python `if-elif-else` syntax to practice control flow and logical branching.

### 2. While Loops  
Implements a factorial calculator using a `while` loop to demonstrate iteration and accumulation.

### 3. Functions  
Defines a reusable function to test whether a number is **prime**, returning Boolean results for multiple test cases.

### 4. List Comprehension  
Uses list comprehension and the previously defined `is_prime()` function to generate a list of **distinct prime factors** of an integer.

### 5. Recursive Functions  
Implements recursion to generate the *n-th* row of **Pascal’s Triangle**, then rewrites the same logic using iterative loops for comparison.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand and manipulate Python data types and structures  
- Practice control flow with conditionals and loops  
- Write reusable functions and apply recursion  
- Gain familiarity with Pythonic constructs such as list comprehensions  
- Translate mathematical logic (e.g., factorial, Pascal’s triangle) into executable code

## Files
- `Py_Project_1_due_1019.ipynb` — single notebook containing all code sections and test cases  
- `Py1_outputs.pdf` — PDF version showing the executed notebook and verified outputs

---

## How to Run
1. Open the notebook in Jupyter Lab, VS Code, or Google Colab.  
2. Run each cell sequentially to view outputs for all problems.  
3. Alternatively, open `Py1_outputs.pdf` to see confirmed outputs without re-running the notebook.

**AI assistance note:**  
All code implementation, logic, and results are my own. (AI helped me organize the README.md)
